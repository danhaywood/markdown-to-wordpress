One of the earlier decisions you'll need to make when building your app is the technology for the UI.

If you're an afficionado of front-end frameworks, you'd quite possibly reach for something like React, Angular or Vue), with corresponding controllers for the backend.
Or if you prefer Java over Javascript, and prefer your UI to be defined at the server, you might use Vaadin, PrimeFaces or even Apache Wicket.
Or you might prefer to be retro and look to HTMX, following the HATEOAS.
