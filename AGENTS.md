For this project, I want codex to safely and incrementally implement the codebase.
There are a set of scenarios, and I'll prepare the input and expected output (approved) in each case. 

Uses mvn 3.9+ and Java 21+.

The tests are implemented using approval tests.

There may be TODOs that provide hints in the codebase as well; pay attention to these.

Only implement the minimum required in order to pass the tests.
